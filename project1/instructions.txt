Project One - Marist Room Reservation Recommender

Important Notice: This is a hands-on team project. It is strongly suggested that both team members spend an equal amount of time on project-related activities, including coding. In other words, it will be extremely difficult to keep your 'A', if you are not hands-on with PHP. You cannot get hands-on by browsing through the lecture slides and reading tutorials.

In this project, you are expected to write three PHP pages, as follows: 

The initial page will display an HTML form and display&ask for the following information, to be [HTML-]submitted to the second page:
Name, CWID, Residential Life Options List and Selection
Student Status Information (class, gender, special needs, etc.)
Student Preferences (laundry on premise, apartment/townhouse, co-ed/non-co-ed, etc.)

The second page will take, parse, and display user input from the first page, and will do one of the two options, depending on user input:

If the user has selected an entry from Residential Life Options, verify whether user submitted information, and preferences are a match with the selection, display the result. 
	A negative result will display an option to go back to the previous page, and 

	a positive result will display an option to go to the next page. 

If the user has not made any selection, filter and display relevant Residential Life Options based on their preferences and information. User then should be able to make a selection and move to the third page. 

The last page will take user selection from the second page, and confirm the reservation request with all details (so that the user can save it as a PDF or print it if they wanted to). 
Due Friday, February 27, 2015, 6pm. 

What to submit: Three well-tested, working PHP pages. Incomplete, buggy, non-working code will mostly get minimal/zero credit. 

30% Bonus: submit a single PHP page that combines all three pages.
