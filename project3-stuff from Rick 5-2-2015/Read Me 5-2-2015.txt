Hello Rebecca

Not sure what you have done so far, so I used the latest
stuff on Github.

Here's what i have done so far:

1. created a new table called "login".  It is simple, has
columns for userid and password.  There are some dummy entries,
and an Administrator login (admin, admin).

2. "index.php"
Modified this page to go to either "login_check.php" or 'signup.php
If the user clicks "Login" it sets a variable in POST to 'login'; 
if they click 'Sign Up' it sets a variable in POST to 'newuser'

3. "login.php"
Modified the form. It asks for a username and password. Then goes
to "login_check.php" 

4. "signup.php"
New file.  Has a form for collecting the username, password,
student's name, CWID, gender, and class.  Clicking the button
directs flow to "login_check.php"

5. "login_check.php" 
New file. You get here from either "login.php" or "signup.php"

IF someone logs in (i.e. not a new user):
takes the username and password and checks it against the entries
in the "login" table.  IF the username is not valid, prints out
a message and provides a link to go back to the login page.
IF the username is valid, takes them to the Reservation page.

IF you are a new user, it adds an entry with the username and password
into the "login" table in the dB, then takes them to the Reservation page.

So this is as far as i got today.....
